## 🛒 The Basic Application

Juice Shop is designed to resemble a standard web shop. In the upper right corner, there is a dropdown menu which unfolds the site’s main navigation panes.

*Dropdown menu with links to various sections like 'Basket', 'Track Orders', etc.*

Next to it, you’ll find a search bar, language selector, and login/logout button.

*Right corner interface for search, language selection, and authentication.*

Other than that, the interface is relatively intuitive and minimalist.
