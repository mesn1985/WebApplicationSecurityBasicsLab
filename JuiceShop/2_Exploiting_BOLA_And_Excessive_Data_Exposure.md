# Broken Object Level Authorization and Excessive data exposure

The exercises in this section, are repetition of what was learned in [crAPI - Exploiting BOLA  and excessive data Exposure](../crAPI/2_Exploiting_BOLA_And_Excessive_Data_Exposure.md).

## 1 - BOLA using object ids without authorization
Can user B view the content of user A's shopping basket?  

## 2 - Excessive Data exposure
Can you find some information about other users?
This one is a bit tricky, and yet not so tricky. You can find the 
excessive data exposure the first time you enter this page, but not 
the second (Unless you have cleared your browser history).


## 3 - Combine the previous 2 weaknesses to access other users baskets
The combination of the previous 2 vulnerabilities, allows you to access 
a variety of users shopping basket.
