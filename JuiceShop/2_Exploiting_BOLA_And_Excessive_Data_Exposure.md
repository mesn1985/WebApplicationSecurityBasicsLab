# 🧪 Broken Object Level Authorization and Excessive Data Exposure

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Apply knowledge of BOLA and excessive data exposure in a new application context.
- Identify insecure access control by manipulating object identifiers.
- Recognize exposure of sensitive user information through improper data handling.
- Combine multiple vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.

---

These exercises are a **repetition and progression** of concepts learned in [crAPI – Exploiting BOLA and Excessive Data Exposure](../crAPI/2_Exploiting_BOLA_And_Excessive_Data_Exposure.md), applied now in the **Juice Shop** environment.

Compared to crAPI, instructions here are less detailed—encouraging independent problem-solving.

> 🧠 **Reminder**: BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) occurs when applications expose object identifiers (like user IDs or basket IDs) in URLs or requests without properly verifying ownership.

---

## 1️⃣ BOLA via Unchecked Object IDs

Can **User B** view the contents of **User A’s** shopping basket?

> 💡 *Hint: Recall how you identified and tampered with object IDs in crAPI. Try a similar approach using Juice Shop’s API endpoints or browser dev tools.*

## 2️⃣ Excessive Data Exposure

Can you uncover personal information about other users?

> 🔎 You may only see this **once per session** — try clearing browser history or using Incognito/Private mode to reproduce the behavior.

When you find user data, consider:
- Is a **password hash** exposed?
- Can you crack it using a tool like [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net)?

🎯 **Objective:**  
Use exposed information to attempt **authentication as another user**.

🎯 **Bonus Objective:**  
Investigate whether the system uses **salts** in its password hashing.  
*Hint: If hashes of identical passwords look the same, salts are likely missing.*

## 3️⃣ Combine and Exploit

Use the data exposure and BOLA weakness together:
- Can you **correlate user emails, IDs, or basket information**?
- Can you use the basket ID of another user found in Task 2 to access their shopping cart?

> 🔄 *This mirrors how attackers use multiple vulnerabilities in combination to pivot within an application.*
  
## 4️⃣ Even More BOLA vulnerabilities

Can you solve the following 3 challenges againt Juiceshop:

  - Forge feedback from another user
  - Create or edit another users product review
  <!-- - Edit another users adress. -->



---

## 🧠 Reflection Questions

- What information was exposed, and under what conditions?
- What types of authorization checks were missing in this scenario?
- How could the application better enforce access control?
- What changes would prevent users from accessing other users’ data?
