# Authorization exploits

## 1 - Referencing objects without authorization
The purpose of this exercise is to provide the basic understanding of how a BOLA vulnerability might look.
  
You should create 2 users(i will call them user A and B from now on), and register a vehicle for each user (Which you recieve in the welcome mail).
Then you should start analysing the application using a tool like burp suite to intercept every request send by the application, and every response 
recieved. In the vehicle details dashboard, one of the interactive features requests information using a resource id. Capture this request with 
user A and note down the resource id. Then switch account to user B, and capture the same request with burp suite, and send it to the forwarder, 
and replace the resource id with the resource id caputered with user A.

_This also relates to a vulernability relating to exceseive information exposure_


## 2 - Referencing objects without authorization
The purpose of this exercise is to provide the basic understanding of how a BOLA vulnerability might look.
You should create 2 users(i will call them user A and B from now on), and register a vehicle for each user (Which you recieve in the welcome mail).
Then you should start analysing the application using a tool like burp suite to intercept every request send by the application, and every response 
recieved. Try analysis the Contact mechanic process, is there and resource id available,
and can you use these for accessing user A's resources with user B?

_Using site map you can also discover api endpoints_
