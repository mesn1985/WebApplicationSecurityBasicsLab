# Broken Object Level Authorization and Excessive data exposure
Often multiple vulnerabilities in combination causes an application to be compromised.  

In these exercises, you will first identify a [BOLA](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/),
and afterwards you will identify an [excessive data exposure](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/0xa3-excessive-data-exposure/).
The two vulnerabilities in combination, will allow you to obtain the location of other users vehicles.

## 1 - BOLA using object ids without authorization
The purpose of this exercise is to provide the basic understanding of how a BOLA vulnerability might look.
  
You should create 2 users(i will call them user A and B from now on), and register a vehicle for each user (Which you receive in the welcome mail).
Then you should start analyzing the application using a tool like burp suite to intercept every request send by the application, and every response 
received. In the vehicle details dashboard, one of the interactive features requests information using a resource id. Capture this request with 
user A and note down the resource id. Then switch account to user B, and capture the same request with burp suite, and send it to the forwarder, 
then replace the resource id with the resource id captured with user A.
  
Once you are able to obtain User A's vehicle location while being authenticated as user B, you have discovered a BOLA.  
  
_The approach used in this exercise is called A & B testing. Because you try to access user A's rescource with user B_
  
**This vulnerability is a BOLA but also known as Insecure direct object reference (IDOR)**

## 2 - Excessive Data exposure
The purpose of this exercise is to provide the basic understanding of how an excessive data exposure vulnerability might look.  
  
You should now look for information about other users. Is there a feature that leaks information about other users?

## 3 - Explorer OWASP Application Security Verification standard.
OWASP [Application Security Verification standard](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/v4.0.3#latest-stable-version---403) defines 
verifications which one should perform on an application, to ensure that the security levels are correct.  
Examine which section you can find information about Access controls, and if there are any specific mentioning about BOLA/IDOR.
Also examine the standard for any reference on how to test for BOLA/IDOR.

## 4 - Get access to other customers mechanic reports.
There is a BOLA vulnerability which allows user A to see user B's mechanic reports. Can you find it?
